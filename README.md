# Backend

The backend is built using Flask and various machine learning libraries (eg. PyTorch and Tensorflow). To run the server locally, install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate DLW
python3 main.py
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:8080` by default.
